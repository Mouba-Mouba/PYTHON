Who, what, and when:effective therapy for severe COVID-19.

The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, and the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant has resulted in disease resurgence. As many as 20% of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 suffer from hyperinflammatory COVID-19, resulting in hospitalisation with COVID-19 pneumonia. Although old age and comorbidities (eg, diabetes, obesity, and hypertension) are risk factors for severe COVID-19, the delta variant has affected young, often previously healthy, individuals, some of whom have to be admitted to intensive care units. Although broad immunosuppression with glucocorticoids has been life-saving, defining those with hyperinflammatory COVID-19 who might benefit from targeted approaches to dampening proinflammatory cytokines has been challenging. Early during the pandemic, concentrations of serum interleukin (IL)-6 were noted to be elevated in patients with severe COVID-19, and multiple clinical trials have explored therapeutic monoclonal antibodies to IL-6 or the IL-6 receptor. Although individual trials have yielded conflicting results, meta-analyses suggest that blockade of IL-6 signalling might enhance survival for patients with severe COVID-19.
