Posttraumatic Stress Namong Pediatric Critical Care Physicians in the United States in Association with Coronavirus Disease 2019 Patient Care Experiences.

Posttraumatic stress among pediatric critical care physicians in the United States in association with coronavirus disease 2019 patient care experiences. Our objective was to assess the prevalence of posttraumatic stress (PTS) and its association with COVID-19 patient care experiences among pediatric critical care physicians. Our study was a cross-sectional study of pediatric critical care physicians in the United States. We measured PTS which included posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and subthreshold posttraumatic stress disorder (SubPTSD) using validated PTSD Checklist- 5 survey tool. Association of PTS with COVID-19 patient care experiences was analyzed using regression analysis. Prevalence of PTS was noted in 120 among 294 pediatric critical care physicians (41%; 95% CI, 35-47%). The predominant symptoms were that of hyperarousal and feelings of negative cognition and mood. Among our physicians with PTS, 19% had PTSD and 81% had SubPTSD. Demographic and practice characteristics were not significant for increased PTS on regression analysis. Posttraumatic stress was significantly associated with physicians testing positive or taking time off for COVID-19 illness, self-isolation, fear of infecting their loved ones, families scared of being infected, feeling helpless, patients expressing fears of dying, having pre-existing depression, anxiety, or insomnia, working beyond comfort level of training and having thoughts of quitting (p < 0.05).
